## Importance

Testerum comes bundled with Selenium drivers for the most popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, Edge, and Opera).

From time to time, browser vendors release a new version of their browser that no longer works with the latest version of the Selenium driver that Testerum has.

At the same time, browser vendors also release a newer version of the Selenium driver which works with the new browser version.

If this happens, you may manually add a new selenium driver to testerum by following the instructions at [here](https://testerum.com/documentation/ui/selenium/). There is no need to update the driver if you use the Safari browser.
